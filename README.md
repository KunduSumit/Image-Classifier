# license_plate_detection

Developed a model to accurately extract license plate information from images or video streams under various environmental conditions and angles.
•	Utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection, to locate license plates in images and video streams.
•	Applied edge detection techniques to identify the contours of license plates.
•	Enhanced image quality using image enhancement methods to improve detection accuracy in challenging conditions.
•	Implemented morphological operations, such as dilation and erosion, to refine the detected edges and reduce noise, ensuring clearer and more precise license plate localization.
•	Usage of techniques like YOLO, edge detection, and image enhancement, resulted in the system achieving higher reliability and precision.
